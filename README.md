# Snake_AI
Here is a Snake AI I programmed in python using Pygame. I used the A* pathfinding algorithm.

It's not entirely perfect, for example, the snake might trap himself or randomly ram into a wall (yeah I'm still scratching my head on that).

So just run the main.py and watch the snake play the game by itself (and eventually die ._.)


# How to run
